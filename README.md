The shaded area is the deviation ($\delta$) of the brachistochrone curve (in red) from the cycloid (in blue). The ratio of the time taken by a rigid cylinder (dotted) as against the time taken by the fluid cyclinder (solid) is $T^*$, a performance metric for the fluid filled cylinder.

Figures (a) and (b) show the variation of $\delta$ and $T^*$ with $\pi_g$ at different values of $\pi_m$. $\delta \to 0$ for both $\pi_g \to 0,\infty$ in (a). Also, $\delta$ is maximum for $\pi_g \approx 3980$ and is nearly invariant for all $\pi_m$. In (b), the locus of the point of maximum deviation is indicated with a red dotted line. Figures (c) and (d) depict their variation versus $\pi_m$ for different values of $\pi_g$.
